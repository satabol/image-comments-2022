    <p>
        Dummy Project is a stand-alone solution and project containing a couple of files 
        that have image-comments in them. Most of the images referred to are from the 
        Windows 7 Sample pictures copied into C:\Temp. There&#39;s another in Dummy 
        Project\Images folder that should be copied to the same place. Dummy Project can 
        only be used for very basic tests out of the box.</p>
